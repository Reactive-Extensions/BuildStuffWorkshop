# Going Async with JavaScript Workshop at BuildStuff.LT 2014 #

These are the materials for the Going Async With JavaScript workshop at [BuildStuff 2014](http://buildstuff.lt/).  This repository contains all the materials to get started with the [Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS)](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS).  After this workshop, you should have all the materials you need to become RxJS experts!  

## Course Material ##

Here are the following materials that are to be used during this workshop.  Please follow along in order for the best learning experience.  We will first start off with Functional Programming in Javascript, course material designed by Netflix and Rx Team to teach people about RxJS.  We will then follow with a short presentation on the Reactive Extensions for JavaScript. Then we will follow that up with some RxJS Koans.  Finally, we will wrap things up with some team challenges to see what the students are capable of building with RxJS!

Note that Functional Programming in Javascript requires the Chrome browser at this point due to some of the original design choices.  Pull requests are welcome to fix these browser incompatibilities.
